2,7,Theory meets Practice,"We are a group of distributed systems researchers in the Department of Computer Science at Cornell University, united in the belief that a deeper understanding of the theoretical framework that shapes the design space is essential to building systems that surpass the performance, scalability, and robustness of the state of the art; and, conversely, that the problems that arise when addressing systems’ “pain points” can serve as a compass to guide us to exciting new theory.
We are not afraid to pursue a problem wherever it will lead us—we build systems and prove theorems with equal gusto and flair. Over the years, we have been exploring problems in message logging, scalable web caching, state machine replication, quorum systems, Byzantine fault-tolerance, and Game Theory. We are currently intrigued by the many facets of the apparent tension between ease of programming and performance in distributed systems and databases: by gaining a deeper understand it of it, our aim is to recognize to what degree this tension is fundamental and, when it is not, develop novel ways to resolve it (see Research). Cornell is one of the intellectual cradles of distributed computing and a special place that embraces researchers who, like us, are attracted by a research style that bridges artificial area divisions in the pursuit of scholarship. We are fortunate to have such travel companions within Cornell’s broader systems group and beyond.

 The explosion of sensors and mobile phones and their interaction with human life funnel a phenomenal amount of data through pervasive computing environments. This data carries a lot of meaningful but hidden information about the people and their environments. The MPSC group at WSU analyze those data in an efficient manner, uncover those hidden patterns, gauge the activity, behavior and interaction of the users and present this to the users, society or application to understand the human and system behavior better.
 Analyzing these data trails can support different applications in a novel way. The applications may vary from personal and community healthcare (smart home independent living, fitness and exercising), green computing (building energy management, environment monitoring), urban sensing (intelligent transportation system, natural resource management), marketing industry (advertisement, consumer shopping habits) and after all social networking.
 We particularly look into sensor data processing and data quality, sensor communications and energy management, sensor-based data mining and machine learning techniques, and intelligent decision making process to observe and shape the user life.
